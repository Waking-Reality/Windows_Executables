# Windows_Executables

Good Day,

I have recently started creating executables for Winodws based on things I have created in PowerShell. Some of these will need to be run as a local administrator to work as in the case of the Windows_Enumeration.exe so it can have access to certain files. I cannot guarantee that these Windows executables will work or not have adverse affects on your system, but they do work well in my test environment.

For general assurance  that you're getting the file I created, I will be hashing each of them in MD5 and SHA1. This can be found by the following process:

[SELECTED_FILE] > "History" > "Add files via upload"

Good luck and I hope that these assist you in your tasks,
